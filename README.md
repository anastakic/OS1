## Kernel thread management and synchronization

Implementation of a small time-sharing operating system kernel. The solution implements and allows concurrent execution of multiple user-written threads on an Intel 8086 compatible CPU.

### Description
  >Multithreading operating system is implemented in C++ (90s version, before C++98 standard). 
  >Some parts of code are written in assembly for Intel 8086 processor.
  >Required compiler: BCC (Borland C++ Compiler), version 3.1
  >Memory model: huge
  >Source/header/library file names should not be longer than 8 characters
  >APPLICAT.LIB lib: Implementation of Scheduler class
